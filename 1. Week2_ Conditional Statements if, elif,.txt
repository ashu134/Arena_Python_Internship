1. Conditional Statements: if, elif, else

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions.

Syntax

if condition:
    # code to run if condition is true
elif another_condition:
    # code if previous condition is false and this is true
else:
    # code if none of the above conditions are true

Example
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
elif age == 17:
    print("Almost eligible")
else:
    print("Not eligible")

2. Comparison Operators

Used to compare values. They return True or False.

Operator	Meaning		Example 	Result
==	Equal to		5 == 5		True
!=	Not equal to		5 != 3		True
>	Greater than		10 > 6		True
<	Less than		2 < 5		True
>=	Greater or equal	8 >= 8		True
<=	Less or equal		4 <= 7		True

3. Lists

Lists store multiple values in a single variable.

Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

Accessing elements
print(fruits[0])  # apple

Modifying
fruits[1] = "grapes"

Adding and removing
fruits.append("orange")   # Add
fruits.remove("apple")    # Remove

4. For Loops

Used to repeat actions for each item in a sequence (list, string, etc.).

Example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)

5. While Loops

Repeats code as long as condition is True.

Example
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

6. Basic Error Handling (try-except)

Used to handle errors so program does not crash.

Example
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(10 / x)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input, please enter a number")
